  # **Daily Rainfall Dataset**  

## **Project Overview**  
The Daily Rainfall dataset provides insights into the rainfall distribution across different districts and states in India during April 2019. This dataset helps analyze weather patterns, assess regional rainfall variability, and support climate-related studies.  

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset records daily rainfall measurements collected by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC).  

### **Dataset Overview:**  
- **Total Records:** 21,990 (from index 0 to 21,989)  
- **Total Columns:** 7  

### **Key Attributes and Their Descriptions:**  
- **State** – The name of the state where the rainfall measurement was recorded.  
- **District** – The name of the district within the state.  
- **Date** – The specific date of the recorded rainfall.  
- **Year** – The year of the rainfall measurement (2019).  
- **Month** – The month of the rainfall measurement (April in this dataset).  
- **Avg_rainfall** – The recorded average rainfall (in mm) for a given district on a particular day.  
- **Agency_name** – The source of data collection (NRSC VIC Model).  

### **Key Insights:**  
- The dataset contains **no missing values** except in the **Avg_rainfall** column, where some records lack data.  
- It covers **daily rainfall patterns** across multiple districts and states.  
- The dataset is valuable for **climate analysis, meteorological studies, and disaster management planning.**  

## **Usage**  
This dataset can be used for:  
- Studying daily and regional rainfall patterns.  
- Climate modeling and weather forecasting.
