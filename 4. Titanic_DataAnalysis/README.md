# **Titanic Survival Dataset**  

## **Project Overview**  
The **Titanic Survival Dataset** aims to analyze passenger demographics and survival rates from the **Titanic disaster**. This dataset is useful for **predictive modeling, survival analysis, and machine learning applications.**  

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset contains **891 entries and 12 columns**, with details about each passenger, including their class, age, fare, and whether they survived.  

### **Dataset Overview:**  
- **Total Records:** 891 (from index 0 to 890)  
- **Total Columns:** 12  

### **Key Attributes and Their Descriptions:**  
- **PassengerId** – Unique ID assigned to each passenger.  
- **Survived** – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).  
- **Pclass** – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).  
- **Name** – Full name of the passenger.  
- **Sex** – Gender of the passenger.  
- **Age** – Age of the passenger (some missing values).  
- **SibSp** – Number of siblings/spouses aboard.  
- **Parch** – Number of parents/children aboard.  
- **Ticket** – Ticket number.  
- **Fare** – Ticket fare paid.  
- **Cabin** – Cabin number (many missing values).  
- **Embarked** – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).  

### **Key Insights:**  
- **Survival analysis** can be performed based on **gender, class, and age**.  
- **Missing values** exist in **Age, Cabin, and Embarked** columns.  
- The dataset is ideal for **machine learning applications** like logistic regression and decision trees to predict survival probabilities.  

## **Usage**  
This dataset can be used for:  
- **Predicting survival chances using machine learning models.**  
- **Understanding demographic factors affecting survival rates.**  
- **Statistical analysis of passenger data.**
