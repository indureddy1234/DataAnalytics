# **Car Price Dataset**  

## **Project Overview**  
The **Car Price Dataset** aims to analyze and predict vehicle prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, engine size, fuel type, and more. This dataset is useful for **automobile market analysis, price prediction models, and consumer insights.**  

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset contains **10,000 entries and 10 columns**, with details about various car attributes that influence their pricing.  

### **Dataset Overview:**  
- **Total Records:** 10,000 (from index 0 to 9,999)  
- **Total Columns:** 10  

### **Key Attributes and Their Descriptions:**  
- **Brand** – The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Kia, Audi, Mercedes).  
- **Model** – The specific model of the car.
